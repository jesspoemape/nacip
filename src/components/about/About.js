                    <h4>About Us</h4>
                    <p>
                        Utah is filled with many vibrant Native American tribal nations and is home to 8 Native American tribes-the Navajo/Dine, Ute Indian Tribe if the Uintah and Ouray, Ute Mountain Ute, White Mesa Community, Skull Valley Band of Goshute, Northwestern Band of Shoshone Nation, Paiute, and the San Juan Southern Paiute. Every July 24th, the Native American Celebration in the Park (NACIP) is the destination for many on Utahâ€™s official holiday. Two cultures merge in recognition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NACIP was established by a few Navajo community members. People were seeking a place where Native cultures can honor their Native heritage through food and song. We began in a little park on the westside of Salt Lake City with a few hundred people. We enjoyed a meal of mutton and fry bread.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NACIP grew bigger than we could have imagined forcing us to move to a new location. Liberty Park is home to NACIP. It was selected as a beautiful backdrop where Native families can dance, sing, and showcase beautiful jewelry and crafts. Among the fragrant pine trees, playground for kids, a cool swimming pool, tennis courts, and aviary and boating opportunities. Guests can enjoy a special experience while witnessing authentic Native American cultures. Audience members can join Native American dancers in the powwow arena as this is signifying friendship and unity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our goal is to share our culture particularly with those who may have not known that Native American people are still here. The Native American population is approximately 70,000 and continues to grow. We have the perfect experience waiting for you and your family.
